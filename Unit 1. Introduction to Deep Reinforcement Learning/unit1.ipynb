We build an agent that learns from the environment by **interacting with it through trial and error** and receiving rewards (negative or positive) as feedback.\n","\n","- The goal of any RL agent is to **maximize its expected cumulative reward** (also called expected return) because RL is based on the _reward hypothesis_, which is that all goals can be described as the maximization of an expected cumulative reward.\n","\n","- The RL process is a **loop that outputs a sequence of state, action, reward, and next state**.\n","\n","- To calculate the expected cumulative reward (expected return), **we discount the rewards**: the rewards that come sooner (at the beginning of the game) are more probable to happen since they are more predictable than the long-term future reward.\n","\n","- To solve an RL problem, you want to **find an optimal policy**; the policy is the \"brain\" of your AI that will tell us what action to take given a state. The optimal one is the one that gives you the actions that max the expected return.\n","\n","There are **two** ways to find your optimal policy:\n","\n","- By **training your policy directly**: policy-based methods.\n","- By **training a value function** that tells us the expected return the agent will get at each state and use this function to define our policy: value-based methods.\n","\n","- Finally, we spoke about Deep RL because **we introduce deep neural networks to estimate the action to take (policy-based) or to estimate the value of a state (value-based) hence the name \"deep.\"**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qDploC3jSH99"},"source":["# Let's train our first Deep Reinforcement Learning agent and upload it to the Hub 🚀\n","\n","## Get a certificate 🎓\n","\n","To validate this hands-on for the [certification process](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/en/unit0/introduction#certification-process), you need to push your trained model to the Hub and **get a result of >= 200**.\n","\n","To find your result, go to the [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard) and find your model, **the result = mean_reward - std of reward**\n","\n","For more information about the certification process, check this section 👉 https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/en/unit0/introduction#certification-process"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HqzznTzhNfAC"},"source":["## Set the GPU 💪\n","\n","- To **accelerate the agent's training, we'll use a GPU**.
